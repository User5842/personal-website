title: "Consistency Is the Hardest—and Most Rewarding—Part"
---

Consistency is _the_ hardest part of any goal you're working toward. It’s not the excitement of starting or the clarity of the vision—it’s showing up _over and over again_, even when life throws curveballs.

Most people never make it past that stage. I know, because I’ve lived it.

I’ve always had big goals. Ambitious ones. But time and time again, I’d start strong, only to fall off when “life” inevitably got in the way—work, stress, distractions, you name it. And it used to feel like starting over every time.

But there are a few key lessons I’ve learned—some silver linings that make consistency not only possible, but _actually_ enjoyable.

## Start Smaller Than You Think

For a long time, I overestimated what I could handle right away. If I wanted to start working out, I’d commit to five days a week—_right out the gate_. Or if I wanted to lean out, I’d cut 1,000 calories and be starving by day three. The crash always came.

Eventually, I realized I was biting off way more than I could chew. And more importantly, I was letting my _ego_ drive the plan. I thought grit and willpower would carry me—but consistency isn’t about going hard. It’s about going _long_.

👉 Start with something so small it feels almost silly. Two workouts a week. A 200-calorie deficit. A 10-minute writing session. The early wins will start stacking, and before long, those tiny habits become part of your identity.

**The takeaway**: Measured steps build momentum. Start small, grow steady, and don’t worry about anyone else’s pace. Your lane is just fine.

## Forgive Yourself—And Keep Going

You’re doing great for a few days. Maybe even weeks. Then… you get sick. You travel. You miss a day. Or maybe you just _don’t feel like it_.

Guess what? That’s completely okay.

You’re not failing. You’re living.

What matters is the trend—not the blip. One missed day (or even three) doesn’t erase the effort you’ve already put in. The key is not to let one break turn into a full stop.

👉 Zoom out. As long as your “on” days outnumber your “off” days, you’re making progress.

**The takeaway**: Self-improvement is about the _average_ over time. Don’t chase perfection—chase persistence.

## Let the Snowball Roll

Ever build a snowball? (I’ve only done it a couple times myself—shoutout to Wisconsin.) Or maybe you’ve played _Katamari Damacy_, where you roll a ball that gets bigger and bigger.

That’s what consistency feels like. It starts out small. Awkward. Sometimes discouraging. But as long as you keep rolling, it grows.

👉 Every small action adds up. What seems tiny now will look massive in a few months. You just have to keep going.

**The takeaway**: Progress compounds. Don’t wait for motivation—trust the motion.

## Consistency Is Contagious

Right now, I’m in a dieting phase, trying to get lean (yep, I want a six-pack at least once in my life). My wife got me a food scale two Christmases ago, and only recently did I start using it daily. I weigh my meals, track my intake, and take five extra minutes each morning to stay on track.

And it’s working. I’m seeing results—not just physically, but mentally.

👉 That same consistency has started bleeding into other parts of my life—my blog, my YouTube channel, even my mornings. The more I practice discipline in _one_ area, the easier it gets to apply it somewhere else.

**The takeaway**: Build consistency in one place, and it becomes your new default everywhere.

## Final Thoughts

Consistency isn’t glamorous. It’s not loud. It doesn’t shout for attention.
But it _works_—every time.

So whatever you’re working on—whether it’s your health, your career, your creativity, or just showing up for yourself—remember this:

✅ Start small  
✅ Stay kind to yourself  
✅ Keep rolling  
✅ Watch it spill over into everything

Your future self will thank you.

Peace ✌️
