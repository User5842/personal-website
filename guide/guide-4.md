Starting your career in tech can be overwhelming. As someone who’s navigated the challenges of software engineering, I’ve made plenty of mistakes along the way. Today, I want to share three career mistakes I made early on that stunted my growth, and how you can avoid making the same ones.

## Pigeonholing Myself Too Early

When I first began my career, I fell into the trap of focusing exclusively on front-end development. It’s common for new developers to start with languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and to pick up frameworks like React or Angular. I dove headfirst into front-end projects, which led to becoming “the front-end guy” on my team.

At first, this seemed like a good thing—I was gaining expertise in one area. But soon, I realized I was missing out on valuable opportunities in back-end engineering, which made up a much larger part of our team. I was limiting myself by not branching out early enough, which slowed down my overall growth.

**The Lesson**: If you’re new to software development, avoid focusing too narrowly on one area. It’s important to get exposure to as much of the stack as possible early on. Later, when you have more experience, you can specialize if you choose, but in the beginning, aim for breadth, not depth.

## Taking Feedback Too Personally

Feedback is one of the most valuable tools for growth, yet early in my career, I was incredibly sensitive to it. If I received criticism—whether it was about my code or my communication—I would take it personally. I would get upset or defensive, thinking that people didn’t understand my perspective.

It wasn’t until a close friend of mine (who eventually became one of my best friends) told me to “get better” that I realized how crucial it was to use feedback constructively. Instead of getting upset, I learned to reflect on the criticism and ask myself, “How can I improve?”

**The Lesson**: Don’t let your emotions get in the way of your growth. Take feedback as an opportunity to get better, and seek out mentors who can offer honest, constructive criticism. The ability to process and apply feedback will accelerate your growth far more than wallowing in negative emotions.

## Being a Yes Man

Another mistake I made early in my career was trying to appear like I knew everything. In meetings, if someone asked, “Do you understand this?” I would say, “Yes,” even if I didn’t fully understand what was being discussed. This approach led to confusion and, in some cases, mistakes in my work. My manager noticed this disconnect and pointed it out to me.

The solution? Be honest about what you don’t know. If you don’t understand something, it’s better to admit it and ask for clarification. Asking questions not only helps you understand better, but it also shows humility and a willingness to learn. Don’t be afraid to ask for deeper explanations or more time to process information. You’ll earn more respect by asking questions than by pretending to know everything.

**The Lesson**: Being transparent about what you don’t know will help you grow faster and avoid misunderstandings. Don’t be afraid to ask questions or ask for more details if something doesn’t make sense. It’s better to ask once than to make assumptions and waste time later.

## Final Thoughts

If I could go back, I would tell my younger self to avoid these three mistakes: pigeonholing, being too sensitive to feedback, and pretending to know it all. By embracing a more open, flexible approach to learning and growth, I would have advanced in my career much faster.

If you're just starting out, or if you're a few years into your career and still making these mistakes, don't worry—you’re not alone. Use these lessons to avoid the same pitfalls and accelerate your career growth.
