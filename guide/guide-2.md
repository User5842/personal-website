We all want to continue progressing in our careers, but for some, the road to getting there is unclear.

Sometimes, companies don't publish clear guidelines for advancing to the next level. Still, after being promoted twice and observing a lot, I have developed a four-step promotion framework.

I followed this framework for every promotion I received and am currently on step 3 for what I hope is a promotion in a year or so.

## 1. Settling into your new role

### Become a sponge

During this period, you either just started your career or are in the first couple of days/weeks/months of your new role.

Soak up as much as you can to learn the company culture. Learn how things get done. Learn about what happens when things go right and when things go wrong. How are your colleagues praised or criticized?

Being observant here will allow you to understand what makes people successful in the company.

### Identify key players

You also want to find the team's key players. Usually, it's obvious who is performing at the top level and getting opportunities constantly.

Befriend them. Set up lunch with them. Pick their brain and effectively mirror their actions. If you do what other successful people do, you will perform the same.

This doesn't necessarily need to be someone at your same level. It could be other individual contributors or even managers.

### Don't bite more than you can chew

When I was assigned my first big project, I was eager to do it all independently and over-perform. I remember walking up to my manager then and asking them if I could do it by myself and to please take the other engineers off the team. He looked at me, laughed, and said:

> "Rafael, don't worry about any of that right now. Focus on delivering the work with the team. If you do it alone, you will fail."

There's a lesson to be learned here. At the beginning of your career, while you should learn to be somewhat autonomous, you should also learn to work with your team. Learning to be an effective communicator, delegating work, splitting up problems, and presenting on progress is difficult but necessary.

## 2. Become effective and identify key impact areas.

After a couple of months or a year of settling into your new role, you will begin to understand what needs to get done on your team and what is expected of you.

This part of the framework is a research and measurement phase.

### Key performance indicators

The AI overview definition of key performance indicators is: "measurable values that demonstrate how effectively an organization, department, or individual is achieving key business objectives, serving as a gauge for progress and informing strategic decisions."

What does this mean?

It means that you want to find holes in processes or technical components that align with the KPIs of the company. KPIs are typically made known to employees either through organizational meetings or by a manager. If you can work on things that align with the KPIs, you won't have to worry about if your work is valuable. It's job security,

### Become measured

Let your managers and peers know about the work you want to do. Ask them if it's worthwhile and ensure you're on the right track.

Asking for feedback will never hurt you, so get used to getting it. Whether good or bad, lousy criticism is the best way to grow your career and confidence.

### Don't wait to be told what to do.

If you have a strong gut feeling that something is an issue and should be fixed, odds are it's a good thing to work on. This stage will require you to get out of your comfort zone and take action. Do first and ask for forgiveness later. It's better to demo something you worked on that could benefit the team before asking for it. Granted, you get your work done while doing it.

## 3. Develop and implement impactful actions

This is the best part of the framework because it's where you implement whatever you came up with on your shortlist from step 2. It's what separates the ones who get promoted from those who don't.

### Communicate to leadership

It's time to take your list to your manager, present it to them, and let them know what your plan is. Be clear in this step. Present a detailed timeline of your action plan and what success means in each area.

> I want to change x, y, and z.

> I want to improve x, y, z.

> I think there is a way to improve on x, y, and z, and we can change them to a, b, and c.

### Don't stretch yourself thin.

I am a firm believer in working smart and not hard(harder than you need to). If you find yourself stressing too much, missing out on sleep, or having your life affected by what you're attempting to do, take a step back and reassess your plan.

Your life outside of work is just as important as your life inside of work, and without adequate rest and relaxation, you will not be able to perform at your best.

If you need help, ask the more senior folk how they would approach the problems and try to learn effective ways of breaking things down.

### Align your plan with business needs.

Use your manager and/or PMs to ensure that your plan aligns with those KPIs and business needs. Even though we already did this in step 2, we should continually reassess our work to ensure we're not wasting time.
