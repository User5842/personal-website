Advancing in your career can feel unclear, especially when companies don't publish guidelines for promotions. After two promotions and plenty of observation, I developed a four-step framework that helped me progress—and I’m currently working through step 3 for my next promotion.

## 1. Settle Into Your New Role

- **Become a sponge**: Absorb company culture, learn processes, and understand how success is measured.

- **Identify key players**: Befriend high performers—both peers and managers. Mimic their behaviors to succeed.

- **Don’t bite off more than you can chew**: Learn to collaborate effectively and communicate with your team rather than trying to do it all independently.

## 2. Become Effective and Identify Key Impact Areas

- **Understand KPIs**: Find processes or areas that align with company goals and focus on them.

- **Get feedback**: Don’t be afraid to ask for feedback and use it to improve.

- **Take initiative**: If you see something that needs fixing, act on it—even if it means asking for forgiveness later.

## 3. Develop and Implement Impactful Actions

- **Communicate to leadership**: Present a clear, detailed action plan to your manager. Align your efforts with business needs.

- **Work intelligently**: Avoid stretching yourself too thin. Use methods like [Pomodoro](https://pomofocus.io) to stay productive without burning out.

- **Advocate for yourself**: Regularly showcase your work and communicate your promotion intentions to leadership.

## 4. Get Promoted

- **Evangelize leadership**: Act like you’re already in the next role—lead and teach others.

- **Handle rejection well**: If you're denied, learn from feedback, iterate on your approach, and keep improving.

- **Focus on soft skills**: Build relationships, practice communication, and develop your leadership presence.

- **Align with timing and structure**: Understand the promotion cycle at your company, and be ready when the time is right.
