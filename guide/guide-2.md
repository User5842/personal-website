We all want to continue progressing in our careers, but for some, the road to getting there is unclear.

Sometimes, companies don't publish clear guidelines for advancing to the next level. Still, after being promoted twice and observing a lot, I have developed a four-step promotion framework.

I followed this framework for every promotion I received and am currently on step 3 for what I hope is a promotion in a year or so.

## 1. Settling into your new role

### Become a sponge

During this period, you either just started your career or are in the first couple of days/weeks/months of your new role.

Soak up as much as you can to learn the company culture. Learn how things get done. Learn about what happens when things go right and when things go wrong. How are your colleagues praised or criticized?

Being observant here will allow you to understand what makes people successful in the company.

### Identify key players

You also want to find the team's key players. Usually, it's obvious who is performing at the top level and getting opportunities constantly.

Befriend them. Set up lunch with them. Pick their brain and effectively mirror their actions. If you do what other successful people do, you will perform the same.

This doesn't necessarily need to be someone at your same level. It could be other individual contributors or even managers.

### Don't bite more than you can chew

When I was assigned my first big project, I was eager to do it all independently and over-perform. I remember walking up to my manager then and asking them if I could do it by myself and to please take the other engineers off the team. He looked at me, laughed, and said:

> "Rafael, don't worry about any of that right now. Focus on delivering the work with the team. If you do it alone, you will fail."

There's a lesson to be learned here. At the beginning of your career, while you should learn to be somewhat autonomous, you should also learn to work with your team. Learning to be an effective communicator, delegating work, splitting up problems, and presenting on progress is difficult but necessary.

## 2. Become effective and identify key impact areas.

After a couple of months or a year of settling into your new role, you will begin to understand what needs to get done on your team and what is expected of you.

This part of the framework is a research and measurement phase.

### Key performance indicators

The AI overview definition of key performance indicators is: "measurable values that demonstrate how effectively an organization, department, or individual is achieving key business objectives, serving as a gauge for progress and informing strategic decisions."

What does this mean?

It means that you want to find holes in processes or technical components that align with the KPIs of the company. KPIs are typically made known to employees either through organizational meetings or by a manager. If you can work on things that align with the KPIs, you won't have to worry about if your work is valuable. It's job security,

### Become measured

Let your managers and peers know about the work you want to do. Ask them if it's worthwhile and ensure you're on the right track.

Asking for feedback will never hurt you, so get used to getting it. Whether good or bad, lousy criticism is the best way to grow your career and confidence.

### Don't wait to be told what to do.

If you have a strong gut feeling that something is an issue and should be fixed, odds are it's a good thing to work on. This stage will require you to get out of your comfort zone and take action. Do first and ask for forgiveness later. It's better to demo something you worked on that could benefit the team before asking for it. Granted, you get your work done while doing it.

## 3. Develop and implement impactful actions

This is the best part of the framework because it's where you implement whatever you came up with on your shortlist from step 2. It separates the ones who get promoted from those who don't.

### Communicate to leadership

It's time to take your list to your manager, present it to them, and let them know your plan. Be clear in this step. Present a detailed timeline of your action plan and what success means in each area.

> I want to change x, y, and z.

> I want to improve x, y, z.

> There is a way to improve on x, y, and z; we can change them to a, b, and c.

### Don't stretch yourself thin.

I firmly believe in working intelligently and not being complex (more complicated than you need to be). If you find yourself stressing too much, missing out on sleep, or having your life affected by what you're attempting to do, take a step back and reassess your plan.

Your life outside of work is just as important as your life inside of work, and without adequate rest, you will not be able to perform at your best.

If you need help, ask the more senior folk how they would approach the problems and try to learn effective ways of breaking things down.

### Align your plan with business needs.

Use your manager and/or PMs to ensure your plan aligns with those KPIs and business needs. Even though we already did this in step 2, we should continually reassess our work to ensure we're not wasting time.

### Advocate for yourself

You should never assume that anyone knows what you want. In this stage, it's essential that you constantly show your work, attend meetings to discuss what you're doing, and communicate your goals to the broader team. You should also be very clear in your intentions. Literally say the words, "I want to get promoted" to your manager so they know what you're trying to accomplish.

## 4. Get Promoted

At this point in the framework, you have settled into your new role, become aware of areas of impact within your team or organization, implemented impactful solutions to those problems, and are now (hopefully) ready for a promotion.

You want to use this time to promote your newfound leadership. Make it known that you are a leader in whatever area(s) you have focused on. Evangelize the topics and teach new ideas to your peers or anyone else in the hierarchy. You should already be acting at the next level without having the title.

Again, I cannot stress this enough: make your intentions known. Present all the data points you have gathered in the last months or years and make a case for yourself.

### I was rejected

Don't worry. I know it's easier said than done. Oddly, you either overshot somewhere or failed to recognize an important issue that needed solving. Whatever feedback you get, be open to it and accept it for what it is. This is the best time to understand your performance, so pay special attention.

You should take some time to revisit a step. For example, maybe you thought you had identified key problem areas but didn't, so you went back to step 2. Perhaps you thought you made a big enough impact in step 3 but failed to communicate your efforts to anyone else. You can constantly iterate and revisit the steps where you need improvement.

### Soft-skills matter

Talk to people. Participate in demos, presentations, meetings, etc. Set up lunches with higher-ups or other seniors on your team. The good thing here is that not only are you making a name for yourself, but you are also practicing your soft skills, which will help you in the long term, especially at higher levels.

### Timing and company structure

Depending on the company, you may be promoted only at certain times throughout the year. You should align your goals with this time. If you work in a more flexible environment, it might be easier to vouch for a promotion anytime.

### Get better

The truth hurts; I know it. You need to get better. Don't overextend yourself if you're not doing great. You don't want to approach your boss and ask for a promotion and have their reaction be poor.

At the beginning of my career, one of my best friends always gave me stern advice. It wasn't the advice I wanted to hear, but it was the advice I needed to hear. Because of him, I have developed a thick skin and realized that the workplace is competitive, so I need to improve and evaluate my skills constantly.
