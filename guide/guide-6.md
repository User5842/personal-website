Staying healthy at work doesn’t need to be complicated. Whether you're in a fast-paced office or working remotely, the little adjustments you make throughout your day can have a huge impact on your physical and mental well-being. Let’s talk about a few simple, yet effective ways you can improve your daily routine without any special equipment or a big time commitment.

## Start Your Day by Getting More Steps In

The journey to better health doesn’t start when you sit down at your desk—it starts the moment you arrive at work. One simple way to get more steps in is to park a little further away from the building. If you work in a parking garage, try parking on the top floor. By walking down those extra flights of stairs in the morning and walking back up after work, you’re adding to your step count and boosting your energy without even thinking about it. In fact, you could be walking up to 30 flights of stairs a day, just from parking a little further and using the stairs instead of the elevator.

If you don’t have access to a parking garage, try parking a few extra spots away from the entrance at your usual lot. The more steps you take, the better you’ll feel, both physically and mentally.

## Take the Stairs—Not the Elevator

Once you're in the building, don’t let your progress stop there. Skip the elevator and take the stairs whenever possible. Sure, it might seem like an inconvenience at first, but over time, it pays off. Your legs will get stronger, and you’ll improve your cardiovascular health. Plus, the extra movement throughout the day adds up and can even help you lose weight, if that’s a goal for you.

I work on the fifth floor, so every day I take the stairs up and down, adding 20–30 flights to my step count without having to set aside time for extra exercise. Imagine what that could do for your overall health over a month.

## Maximize Your Lunch Break

Lunchtime can be a productivity booster if you use it right. Instead of sitting at your desk or grabbing a snack and plopping down with your coworkers, consider going for a walk during your lunch hour. It’s a great way to get some fresh air, boost your mood, and reset your mind for the rest of the workday.

Not only does walking improve your energy, but it also helps digestion, reduces stress, and offers a natural source of Vitamin D. If you don’t have company for a walk, don’t worry! You can always go solo, use the time to reflect, or listen to an inspiring podcast or audiobook. Walking during lunch gives you a mental break, which makes you more focused when you return to your desk.

## Drink More Water, Less Sugar

The beverages we consume play a significant role in our overall health. By swapping sugary drinks for water, you can boost your energy and stay hydrated throughout the day. Start with a simple plan: drink a couple of cups before lunch, one cup during lunch, and another couple after lunch. This strategy helps to keep your hydration levels up without overwhelming you with a complicated routine.

Drinking more water can make you feel more energized, improve your focus, and even reduce hunger cravings throughout the day.

## Give Your Eyes a Break

In the age of screens, our eyes are constantly being overworked. Whether you’re staring at your computer, phone, or TV, it’s important to give your eyes some rest. A simple strategy is the 20-20-20 rule: every 20 minutes, look away from your screen and focus on something 20 feet away for at least 20 seconds. This helps reduce eye strain and prevents headaches.

If you can, try to get outside and look at something far away, such as a tree or the horizon. And don’t forget about those blue-light blocking glasses—they can help reduce strain from screens. You can also use apps like Night Shift or Flux to adjust your screen’s brightness, depending on the time of day.

## Make Small, Sustainable Changes

It’s easy to get caught up in the desire for big, drastic changes, but the most sustainable way to improve your health is by making small, manageable adjustments to your routine. Start with one or two changes and gradually incorporate them into your daily life. Whether it’s parking a little further from the entrance, taking the stairs, or drinking more water, every small change adds up.

For example, start by walking more during your lunch hour or parking a bit further from your building. As you get used to it, add in other changes, like cutting back on sugary snacks or doing a quick eye exercise every hour. Over time, these small changes will become second nature, and you’ll feel the difference in your energy, productivity, and overall well-being.

These simple hacks can drastically improve your health without taking a huge amount of time or effort. Over time, as you build these habits into your routine, you'll notice significant improvements in your physical health, energy levels, and even your mood at work.
