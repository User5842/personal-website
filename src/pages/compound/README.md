# Simple Compound Interest Calculator

## Description

This is my version of a simple compound interest calculator, inspired by The Money Guys' own calculator: https://moneyguy.com/tool/compound-interest-calculator/.

I wanted to add similar functionality with the added benefit that you could also see the results of your investments when contributing daily.
